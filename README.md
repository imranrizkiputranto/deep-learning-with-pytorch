# deep-learning-with-pytorch
This repository contains code files I have personally coded in conjunction with projects included in the "PyTorch for Deep Learning with Python Bootcamp" online course on Udemy by Jose Portilla.

## Course Description
The "PyTorch for Deep Learning With Python Bootcamp" online course by Jose Portilla is a comprehensive program that teaches learners how to use the PyTorch framework for deep learning. It covers essential topics such as building and training neural networks, working with convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and implementing generative adversarial networks. Through hands-on exercises and projects, learners gain practical experience in applying PyTorch to solve real-world deep learning problems.

## Contents
This repository is organised into multiple folders, each corresponding to a specific section or topic covered in the course. The code files are provided as Python scripts (.py). Additionally, the repository may include datasets and other necessary resources for running the code. The code files are named according to the corresponding lessons or exercises in the course.

## Usage
To use the code files in this repository, you will need a working installation of Python and the necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and PyTorch. You can run the code files by opening them in a Jupyter notebook environment or executing the Python scripts using a Python interpreter. Please note that the code provided in this repository is for educational purposes and meant to accompany the "PyTorch for Deep Learning With Python Bootcamp" course. It is encouraged to experiment, modify, and build upon the code to deepen your understanding of the covered topics.
